Hi! I'm Jay ðŸ‘‹, a CS undergrad from Mumbai University who recently graduated in May 2021. I started my programming career with C language in 2017. I have fluency in programming languages like C, Python, and JavaScript. I have been working on solving problems using ML for over a year now.

I'm currently working as a research intern at the [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) under [Dr. Pengtao Xie](https://sites.google.com/site/pengtaoxie2008) on applying humans' learning skills for Neural Architecture Search, specifically learning from mistakes. I'm also collaborating with [Zeerak Waseem](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=3M3WdvkAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) on Hate Speech Detection using Federated Learning.

I was a Teaching Assistant for the [Unicode Machine Learning Summer Course 2021](https://djunicode.github.io/umlsc-2021/) supported by Google AI Research India. I also conducted a Research Seminar as a part of the Unicode Research Group with the other TAs. [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BNai1MVN7mx0wuAFgYVKfh48YF-D3PDS/view) and [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DEDxLmlsJvCtRh5upyT7fvFI4XQA2fi3/view) for the above seminar are available publicly.

Current areas of interest:
- Multimodal machine learning (Language and Vision Intersection)
- Commonsense Reasoning
- Fairness and bias in language models
- Interpretability

Independent research projects:
- Worked on the task of visual dialog to reduce the bias towards dialog history using mixed attention mechanisms as a part of final year project (Accepted at [ICACDS 2021](https://icacds.com/)).
- Co-authored a paper on using object detection and image processing techniques to estimate the dimension of potholes (Published at [IVCNZ 2020](https://ecs.wgtn.ac.nz/Events/IVCNZ2020/)).
- Co-authored a chapter titled "Combatting COVID-19 using Object Detection Techniques" for Elsevier's CPS-AI & COVID-19 book (Accepted).
- Co-authored papers on using IoT and ML effectively to automate tasks in the agriculture and waste management sectors.

You can find more about the publications on [Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lNn2qGoAAAAJ&hl=en).

I have previously worked as an ML project intern at Tata Consultancy Services, where I got the opportunity to work on understanding customer behavior using NLP. I have also collaborated with Dr. Pratik Kanani on an industry project focusing on anomaly detection in heart rate (pulse) using IoT and ML. I also led a team that developed a platform for conducting C programming examination in the college for over 500 students ([demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kn7lwJoYfuU)).

I was a mentor at [DJ Unicode](https://github.com/djunicode), an open-source organization by our college department, where I help juniors on software development projects as well as learn new stuff too ðŸ˜€.

I have also presented paper reviews as a part of Unicode Research Group on the topics of Variational Inference and Probabilistic Programming (_I have made some mistakes during initial presentations but have constantly tried to improve and learn through discussions with peers_).
- Auto-encoding Variational Bayes ([Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1or8TXSdZx93AIa5eqtAiyMKhKI5fnUiF/view), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSQ129B_2jM&list=PLob0yCmJjJ3U6vUrmExdTpMoRh43c1nXK&index=6), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf))
- Deep Probabilistic Programming ([Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NBji25U3QGr-Zt6qBGTppVaPJ4BE_i1f/view), [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nT8ISRrUixQ&list=PLob0yCmJjJ3U6vUrmExdTpMoRh43c1nXK&index=7), [Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.03757.pdf))
